# IPU One

**The unofficial student companion app for GGSIPU.**
Results, notices, and document collection — without ever touching the university's own portal.

## What it does

GGSIPU's official result portal is a captcha-gated relic. IPU One's [backend](../IPU%20One%20Backend) drives that portal server-side on the student's behalf, so this app gives students a clean, native way to:

- 🔑 **Sign in** with Email OTP or native Google Sign-In (Credential Manager) — no passwords stored on-device.
- 📊 **Import & view results** — CGPA, per-semester trend charts, and subject-level breakdowns, pulled straight from the university portal and parsed automatically.
- 📢 **Browse notices** — university and department announcements, auto-targeted to your program/institute/batch.
- 📄 **Submit documents** — marksheets, NOCs, and certificates sent directly to the student cell, no physical queue.
- 🧑‍🎓 **Track your profile** — enrollment, program, and institute details pulled from the official portal.

## Architecture

Feature-centric MVVM. Each screen owns its `State` and `ViewModel`; shared building blocks live under `core/`.

Talks to the [IPU One backend](../IPU%20One%20Backend), which is the piece that actually impersonates a browser against the real GGSIPU result portal — this app never touches it directly.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest stable)
- JDK 11+
- An emulator or device on API 30+

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd IPUOneApp
```

Open the project in Android Studio and let Gradle sync — it generates `local.properties` for you (SDK path). No API keys are required to build a debug APK.

By default the app points at the live backend:

```kotlin
// app/src/main/java/com/ipu/ipuoneapp/core/config/AppConfig.kt
const val BASE_URL = "http://tmsk864q5tetm736i55qlyi0.213.210.37.18.sslip.io/"
```

To run against a local backend instance from the emulator, change this to:

```kotlin
const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/"
```

### Run

Select a device (API 30+) and hit **Run 'app'** (`Shift+F10`), or from the CLI:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug   # build a debug APK
./gradlew installDebug    # build & install on a connected device/emulator
```

### Test & lint

```bash
./gradlew test                  # JVM unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # instrumented tests (needs a device/emulator)
./gradlew lint
```

### Release builds

Release builds are signed via `signingConfigs` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, which reads `KEYSTORE_PATH`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, and `KEY_PASSWORD` from `local.properties`. Neither the keystore nor `local.properties` are checked into version control — see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore).

## Development guidelines

- **State hoisting**: pass state down from ViewModels to stateless composables; keep composables free of business logic.
- **Design system first**: prefer `core/ui` components (`PrimaryButton`, `AppTextField`, `Header`, `Footer`) over raw Material components to keep the app on-brand.
- **DTOs mirror the backend**: when the backend's response shape changes, update the matching type under `data/model` rather than parsing ad hoc JSON in a ViewModel.
